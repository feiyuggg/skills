## Durable user preferences updated

### Investment analysis output format
- User explicitly requested stock analysis to follow a fixed Feishu-friendly template format.
- Required structure includes sections 0-7 with separators and final conclusion block.
- User said: "输出模式不对 和之前有差异" and then provided a concrete template to follow.
- Going forward: keep template stable and do not change structure unless asked.

### Investment style preference shift
- User asked to reduce emphasis on short-term safety margin in analysis.
- User preference: value investing should focus more on a 3-5 year horizon.
- Practical implication: prioritize business quality, moat durability, and 3-5 year cash-flow/growth realization over short-term valuation noise.
- New preference: when asking about US stock monthly/seasonal trends on a yearly basis, include a dedicated section on defensive stocks that are investable during drawdowns, with actionable allocation ideas.
- New preference: in market analysis, explicitly incorporate midterm election cycle effects, holiday effects, and specific month seasonality patterns.
- New preference: for value-investing analysis, include an options cashflow rule using OTM long calls; trim long-call positions when gains reach +50% to +100%, and recycle proceeds into core stock positions.
- New preference refinement: OTM long call tenor should generally be at least 6 months, with a preference for 12+ months.
- New template preference: long OTM call section must include concrete contract levels (expiration + strike), not only abstract ranges.

### File storage preference
- User approved storing part of generated files on external drive.
- Preferred external disk path: `/Volumes/WD SSD`.
- Agreed directory convention for larger/generated artifacts:
  - `/Volumes/WD SSD/openclaw/reports`
  - `/Volumes/WD SSD/openclaw/data`
  - `/Volumes/WD SSD/openclaw/media`
  - `/Volumes/WD SSD/openclaw/archive`

### Communication preference
- User requested colloquial localized wording at times (e.g., Wuhu dialect phrasing).
- User is also okay with receiving voice output; voice message delivery was successfully used once.

### Operational issues to remember
- User asked how to configure memory key after memory retrieval failed.
- Current environment issue: `memory_search` unavailable unless embeddings provider credentials are configured.
- Practical fix given: set real `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or configure provider key in auth profiles), then restart gateway.
