## Durable user preferences

- User requested that all future stock analyses include explicit target prices for the next **1 year to 1.5 years**.
- Preferred output format for target prices: scenario-based structure (Base/Bull/Bear) is acceptable and aligned.
- User explicitly asked to use the **stock-analyzer skill** for stock analysis tasks.

## Context notes

- Completed a GOOGL analysis with stock-analyzer skill and then added 12M/18M target-price scenarios.
