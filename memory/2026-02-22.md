## Durable user preferences updated

### Investment analysis output format
- User explicitly requested stock analysis to follow a fixed Feishu-friendly template format.
- Required structure includes sections 0-7 with separators and final conclusion block.
- User said: "输出模式不对 和之前有差异" and then provided a concrete template to follow.
- Going forward: keep template stable and do not change structure unless asked.

### Investment style preference shift
- User asked to reduce emphasis on short-term safety margin in analysis.
- User preference: value investing should focus more on a 3-5 year horizon.
- Practical implication: prioritize business quality, moat durability, and 3-5 year cash-flow/growth realization over short-term valuation noise.

### File storage preference
- User approved storing part of generated files on external drive.
- Preferred external disk path: `/Volumes/WD SSD`.
- Agreed directory convention for larger/generated artifacts:
  - `/Volumes/WD SSD/openclaw/reports`
  - `/Volumes/WD SSD/openclaw/data`
  - `/Volumes/WD SSD/openclaw/media`
  - `/Volumes/WD SSD/openclaw/archive`

### Communication preference
- User requested colloquial localized wording at times (e.g., Wuhu dialect phrasing).
- User is also okay with receiving voice output; voice message delivery was successfully used once.
