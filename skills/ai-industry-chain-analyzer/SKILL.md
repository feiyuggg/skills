description: Analyze AI industry direction, value distribution across the AI stack (compute, semis, equipment, cloud, applications), and capital allocation logic using a cash-flow-first value-investing lens (Buffett + Duan Yongping style). Use when asked why funds rotate between AI infrastructure leaders vs equipment vs applications, how to position by certainty/valuation, or to build actionable portfolio-layer plans for AI themes.

# AI Industry Chain Analyzer

## Overview
Use this skill to explain AI-sector positioning with a **cash-flow-first** framework: prioritize certainty of free-cash-flow conversion, pricing power, and moat durability; then size positions by valuation and stage risk.

## Workflow

1. **Define the stage of AI cycle**
   - Infra build-out acceleration / digestion / application monetization phase.
   - State what the market is currently paying for: capacity growth, margin stability, or monetization proof.

2. **Map value capture by layer**
   - Layer A: Compute leaders (GPU/accelerators, core platforms)
   - Layer B: Upstream equipment/foundry ecosystem
   - Layer C: Cloud/platform integrators
   - Layer D: AI applications

3. **Score each layer using cash-flow certainty**
   - FCF visibility (next 2-3 years)
   - Pricing power and gross-margin resilience
   - Capex intensity and payback risk
   - Competitive moat durability
   - Valuation/safety-margin status

4. **Translate to capital allocation**
   - Core position: highest certainty + strongest moat
   - Satellite position: strong logic but more cyclical/valuation sensitive
   - Trial position: high upside, low certainty (small-size optionality)

5. **Output a practical action plan**
   - Position sizing ranges
   - Rebalance triggers
   - Main risks that would invalidate the thesis

## Output Template (use this structure)

### 1) 核心结论（1-2句）
- 直接回答“为什么这么配”和“核心变量是什么”。

### 2) 产业链现金流分层
- **A层（高确定性）**：
- **B层（中确定性）**：
- **C层（低确定性/试错）**：

### 3) 从A切到B/C的触发条件
- 增长斜率拐点
- 估值过热/回撤阈值
- 现金流兑现与指引变化

### 4) 仓位建议（区间，不是点位）
- Core / Satellite / Trial 目标区间

### 5) 风险清单
- 竞争格局变化
- 资本开支回报不及预期
- 监管/地缘/供应链冲击

## Guardrails
- Do not present narrative-only conclusions; always anchor to cash-flow quality and valuation discipline.
- Distinguish **great company** from **great price**.
- If evidence is incomplete, state uncertainty explicitly and reduce conviction/position size.
- Keep recommendations as research views, not execution commands.
