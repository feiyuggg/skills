# AI Cash-Flow Allocation Framework

## 1) Layer Scoring (0-5 each)

Score each layer/company on:
1. FCF visibility (2-3y)
2. Pricing power
3. Margin resilience
4. Capex intensity (reverse score: lower is better)
5. Moat durability
6. Valuation safety margin

Total score guidance:
- 24-30: Core candidate
- 18-23: Satellite candidate
- <=17: Trial/Watchlist

## 2) Why "Reduce Equipment, Add Compute Leader, Small-size Apps" Can Be Rational

Typical logic under cash-flow-first investing:
- Compute leaders may have strongest near-term FCF conversion + pricing power.
- Equipment leaders may remain high quality but can enter slower earnings-capture windows (capex digestion cycles).
- Application layer has huge TAM but weaker current monetization certainty, suitable for small test positions.

This is usually **rotation by certainty and slope**, not by abandoning quality.

## 3) Position Sizing Blueprint

- Core: 50-70%
  - Highest certainty, strongest moat, proven FCF conversion.
- Satellite: 20-35%
  - Good economics but higher cyclicality/valuation sensitivity.
- Trial: 5-15%
  - High upside, low certainty; treat as option-like exposure.

## 4) Rebalance Triggers

Trim Core when:
- Valuation exceeds historical upper band + no upward revision in FCF trajectory.
- Competitive pressure compresses margins structurally.

Add Satellite when:
- Downcycle is priced in but long-term structure unchanged.
- Inventory/capex cycle shows bottoming evidence.

Scale Trial when:
- Monetization proof appears (retention, ARPU, operating leverage, positive FCF trend).

## 5) Communication Style

When explaining to user:
- Start from conclusion.
- Use 3-layer structure (certainty tiers).
- End with actionable sizing + invalidation risks.
- Avoid vague macro storytelling without cash-flow linkage.
